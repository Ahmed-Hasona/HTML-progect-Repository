 <h2>A database management system is important because it effectively manages the data and allows users to perform multiple tasks with ease.</h2>
 <h2>In a single software program, a database management system stores, organizes and manages a vast volume of information.</h2>
 <h2>Use of this system increases operational efficiency and reduces overall costs.</h2>
 <h2>Database management systems are essential to businesses and organizations 
   because they offer a highly efficient method for managing multiple data types.</h2>
 <h2>For example, the human resources department of a organization uses the database to maintain employee documents, 
 distribute employee legal information and produce updated recruiting reports.</h2>
 <h2>Relational databases use several tables, and in addition to data elements, describe relationships between them using a schema.</h2>
